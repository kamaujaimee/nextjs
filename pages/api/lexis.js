As part of opening the new accounts, the co-conspirators would order new cell phones and have them delivered to vacant homes where they would be picked up by other co-conspirators and eventually resold. The conspiracy involved more than 270 packages containing over 830 cell phones that were valued at over USD 595,000.  The conspiracy took advantage of over 240 identity theft victims. \n\nAccording to United States Attorney - Middle District of Pennsylvania; November 22, 2019: On November 25, 2019, Nana Mensah and Patrick Barkers-Woode were convicted on fifteen counts of mail fraud, four counts of aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to commit mail fraud and aggravated identity theft. \n\nMensah and Barkers-Woode, along with other co-conspirators, some located in West Africa, were involved in an international scheme in which co-conspirators would obtain the personal identification information of identity theft victims and use that information to purchase cellular phones.  The conspirators would have the products delivered to homes which appeared vacant.  They would then track the delivery of the packages on line, pick up the packages, and eventually resell them.",
